# 1. This section contain error messages, which are displayed in the player's console.
# 2. __1__ is prefix in format "level: entity-icon: index: ", __2__ is signal icon
# 3. For "input" and "output" use the same words as in the gui for decider combinator.
#    It is also possible to use "input signal" and "output signal"
# 4. This mod is inspired by static analysis tools for programming languages, 
#    so you can use the same wording as it is preffered in programming, compare:
#    "Unused output" - "Unused variable"
#    But prefer keeping wording easy to understand - for example, "input_required "
#    spells out what is wrong.
# 5. Try to keep these messages not too long as they are shown in player's console and 
#    should not cover the network itself too much. But still, ease of understanding 
#    is the priority.
# 6. Do not put periods in the end of the messages. 
# 7. Message no_input_set_trains can be shown only for train stops. 
#    "Check assigned trains" - this means trains that has this stop in the schedule.
# 8. "Use colors" - use the same wording as in Circuit connection settings GUI of a lamp:
#    Circuit conneciton -> Mode of operation -> Use colors
# 9. In "no_vulnerabilities" __1__ is the check mark icon.
#    Exclamation mark in text is optional.

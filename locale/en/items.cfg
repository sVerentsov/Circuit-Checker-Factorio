# General guidelines for translator:
# 1. The comments on translating phrases are not binding. 
#    Feel free to ignore them if you think you know better
# 2. When creating translations in new locale, do not copy comments.

[item-name]
# 1. This is not displayed in UI since Facrorio 1.0, but translate this anyway. 
# 2. Word "checker" in some languages may refer to person, not to tool
#    In this case, translate name of this item as "Tool for checking circuit"
#    or "Tool for checking circuit network"
circuit-checker=Circuit Checker

[item-description]
# 1. This is not displayed in UI since Facrorio 1.0, but translate this anyway. 
# 2. Avoid using words "circuit network", because selecting network can be 
#    misinterpreted as clicking on wires (which are highlited on hover). 
#    Choose some wording to represent wires and connected entities.
#    "Select area of a circuit network" is acceptable.

# 1.This is displayed in bottom panel on hover over shortcut
name=Check circuit

[controls]
# 1. This is displayed in controls settings window
# 2. "circuit checker" here should be translated the same as item-name.circuit-checker
# 3. Try to translate "Put in your hand" in the same way as "Cursor split" setting 
#    of vanilla game  is translated
#    ("Controls settings" -> "Inventory" -> "Cursor split").
#    In English wording of this setting does not fit "Putting in hand", 
#    unlike other languages, for example:
#    German - "Halben Stapel nehmen" (Take a half of a stack)
#    Russian - "Взять в руки половину пачки предметов" (Put a half of an item stack in hand)

#    For example, in German the naming is "Rotes Signalkabel" - use "Signalkabel"
